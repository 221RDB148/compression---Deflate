DEFLATE Compressed Data Format Specification version 1.3
https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt

Deflate is a compression algorithm that was made by Phil Katz in 1996.
 At a time when it was published, it was popular, even till this day i
t is widely being used, article delves deep in the details of how algo
rithm works.
Deflate implements two basic compression methods, Prefix coding (which
 is called Huffman coding in article) and from LZ family, it uses LZSS.
 LZSS compreses text by making references to previously repeated patter
ns in text, for example it could reference word “Deflate” each time it 
is used, insead of writing it every time. Prefix coding analyses given 
data and for each character that is used, it calculates frequency of ho
w much it is used, then gives smaller bit-lengths to most frequently us
ed charecters.
Deflate uses 3 types of blocks, each block has its own way of dealing w
ith given text and the compression comes out of scanning text and seper
ating it in number of blocks wisely, so that each block complements and
 helps each other to function in their own field. First block type stor
es uncompressed data if you consider that short part of text contains t
oo much character kinds, then storing this part uncompressed would be m
ore efficient. Second block type implements LZSS algorithm, but while i
mplementing Prefix coding, it uses already predefined codes for it. Thi
rd block type imlements LZSS like second block type, but insead of havi
ng predefined library of codes for each symbol, it calculates frequency 
of each symbol and makes custom prefix codes for that text.
In summary Deflate is a powerfull compression algorithm, that is still 
used today, which implements two basic compression algorithms and diffe
rent implementations of them to separate text in simpler parts which are compressed seperatley.
